## Cross-Cultural NLP Analysis of Luxury Hotel Reviews in Europe- LDA Topic Modeling 


**Project description:** 
-   Actively led a comprehensive NLP analysis project examining over 515,000 luxury hotel reviews to interpret complex customer latent patterns across diverse global region, utilizing Python and advanced Scikit-learn ML models (Gensim, LDA, clustering, NMF) expecting significant detailed analysis extracted insights.
-   Orchestrated advanced data preprocessing and optimization techniques, along with thorough comparative analyses using R and Tableau expect to contribute to the companyâ€™s market positioning critical strategic decisions.



### Overview

This project aims to analyze hotel reviews to uncover interesting patterns. The motivation stems from the experience of travelers and foodies who often rely on reviews and ratings but sometimes find them misleading. The goal is to look beyond ratings, focusing on review content, priority metrics for luxury hotel guests, and differences in perspectives based on nationality.


### 1. Dataset and Preprocessing
- Data Source: Kaggle ("515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe" from Booking.com)
- Dataset Details: 515K rows from 1493 hotels across various European countries
- Preprocessing involved cleansing (space trimming, missing data removal), discretization (concept hierarchy), and structuring analysis based on regional classifications aligned with Google Maps.
